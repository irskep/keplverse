    # Stellar Dream{.game-title

    It's the year 2200. The earth is in the midst of total ecological
    collapse. A hundred years ago, humanity began building a generation ship,
    hoping that by the time they finished it, they could find a new home in
    the stars.

    A new home was never found, but the ship is finished, and the earth is
    dead. They have no choice but to board it and hope that the shipboard
    artificial intelligence—*that's you*—could both identify a suitable
    planet, and get their descendents there alive.

    Your ship, Stellar Dream, is home to 40,000 humans, all living in a
    virtual reality simulation. They are born, they learn skills necessary to
    colonize a new planet, and they die. They are fed intravenously from a
    food supply that you grow in massive rotating farms.

    You will travel the stars in search of a habitable planet, doing your
    best to keep a viable population of humans alive.
